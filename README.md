## Project Motivation

This project initially began as a personal endeavor to address the prevalent project management challenges within my workplace. In our software development projects, task tracking and management relied heavily on Excel, which proved to be cumbersome due to limitations in cloud syncing functionality. With Excel, only one user could access and edit the task list at a time, leading to frequent sync conflicts and outdated versions being loaded from the server. Consequently, managing tasks became an arduous chore rather than a streamlined process, contributing to inefficiency and frustration among team members.

| MongoDB    | MongoDB's document-oriented data model allows startups to store data in a format that closely resembles the objects used in their code, providing flexibility and agility in development. This flexibility is particularly advantageous in the early stages when product requirements may evolve rapidly. |
| ExpressJS  | Express.js is a minimalistic and unopinionated framework for Node.js, providing just enough features to build robust web applications without imposing unnecessary constraints.                                                                                                                           |
